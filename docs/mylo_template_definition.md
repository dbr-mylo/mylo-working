# Mylo Template Definition

## 1. What is a Template?
A **template** in Mylo is a pre-configured document layout designed to define the **structure**, **styles**, and **design elements** used throughout the document. Templates ensure that content is displayed in a consistent, brand-compliant format without requiring the **Writer** to worry about layout details.

- Templates are created and managed by the **Designer** role.
- They include predefined rules for typography, colors, margins, spacing, headers, footers, and positions for design elements like logos or images.
- The **Writer** focuses purely on content creation, while the template applies the **style and layout** automatically in the **preview panel**.

## 2. Template Structure
A **template** in Mylo consists of several key components that define the document's appearance and layout:

- **Style Settings**:
  - **Typography**: Font family, size, weight, color, and line spacing.
  - **Paragraph Styles**: Alignment, indentation, and spacing between paragraphs.
  - **List Styles**: Bullet points, numbered lists, and indentation levels.

- **Layout Settings**:
  - **Page Margins**: Determines the space around the text.
  - **Text Alignment**: Defines how text is aligned (left, center, right, justify).
  - **Header/Footer Positioning**: Controls where the header and footer appear on each page.
  - **Page Breaks**: Determines how content is split across multiple pages.

- **Design Elements**:
  - **Logos and Images**: Defined positions for logos, brand images, or other design elements.
  - **Predefined Spacing**: Padding and margins around images or text blocks.

- **Metadata**:
  - The **creator** of the template, **version number**, **description of changes**, and associated styles are tracked for each template.

## 3. How Templates Are Used
- **For Designers**:
  - **Create and Manage Templates**: Designers define the layout, typography, and any fixed design elements for the document. This includes managing the overall structure and branding.
  - **Assign Templates to Documents**: A Designer can assign a template to a new or existing document, ensuring all content adheres to the correct design.

- **For Writers**:
  - **Content Creation**: Writers can create and edit content in the **editor panel**, where their work is formatted according to the templateâ€™s predefined rules.
  - **Preview Panel**: Writers see a live preview of the document with the template applied. The layout and design elements (like logos) are automatically applied, but the **Writer** cannot modify these elements.

Writers are free to focus solely on creating and formatting text, while the layout is handled automatically.

## 4. Template Restrictions
- Templates are **non-editable** by the **Writer**. The **Writer** is only allowed to edit the content within the constraints of the template (text, images, links, etc.).
- **Design Elements** (such as logos and branding) are **fixed** in the template and are visible in the **preview panel** but cannot be modified by the **Writer**.
- Templates are typically applied to the **whole document**, though specific sections of a document may have different layouts if needed.

## 5. Template Versioning and Updates
- **Versioning**: Templates are versioned, meaning that each version of a template is stored and tracked. When a **Designer** updates a template (e.g., changes fonts, layout, or branding), that update is reflected in the **preview** for all **Writers** using that template.
- **Version History**: Each template has a version history that includes details like the **creator**, **date of update**, and **change description**. This allows templates to be rolled back to previous versions if necessary.

By versioning templates, Mylo ensures that the design remains consistent, even as updates are made.

## 6. Template Marketplace (Future Consideration)
- **Public/Private Marketplace**: In the future, Mylo may allow **Designers** and **organizations** to share, buy, or download templates from a central marketplace. These templates would be categorized by industry, use case, or design style.

- **Template Customization**: While the current setup does not allow **Writers** to modify templates, there may be future versions of templates that allow limited customization for Writers (e.g., choosing different color schemes or replacing images).

## 7. Template Application and Selection in Mylo Workflow
- **Before Starting to Write**:
   - When a **Writer** opens **Mylo**, they will have the option to **select a template** directly from the **dashboard**. If there are multiple templates available, the **Writer** can choose from a **dropdown menu**, **thumbnail preview**, or other selection method to pick the template that best fits their needs.
  
- **After Starting to Write**:
   - If the **Writer** has already started writing, they can still change the **template** they are using by selecting a new one from a **dropdown menu**, **thumbnail view**, or another easy-to-use method within the writing interface. This allows the **Writer** to switch templates if they feel another layout is more appropriate for the content being created.

This flexibility ensures that **Writers** can easily choose or change templates as needed, either before starting or while working on a document, to ensure the best fit for the content.

## Conclusion
Templates in **Mylo** provide a robust, flexible way to ensure that documents are consistent and aligned with branding guidelines. By separating content creation from design, Mylo makes it easy for **Writers** to focus on creating high-quality content, while **Designers** manage the overall layout and visual style.
