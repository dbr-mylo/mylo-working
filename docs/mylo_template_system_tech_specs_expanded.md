## 1. Template Conflict Handling and Error Warnings

### Content Conflict Detection
When a Writer tries to change or format content that does not fit within the template’s layout or design rules, the system should detect and warn about the conflict. Common conflicts include:

- **Font Size Mismatch**: If the Writer selects a font size that is not allowed by the template’s style settings, a warning should appear.
- **Text Overflow**: If the Writer adds too much content and it doesn’t fit within the defined margins or layout of the template, the system should notify them.
- **Image Alignment Issues**: If an image inserted by the Writer does not align with the template’s pre-defined alignment, the system should prompt the Writer to adjust.

### Warning System
When a Writer encounters a conflict, the system should display a friendly warning or alert with specific instructions:

1. **Font Size Mismatch**:
   - *"Warning: The font size you've chosen exceeds the template’s maximum allowed size. Would you like to adjust the font size to fit the template?"*

2. **Text Overflow**:
   - *"Warning: Your content does not fit within the template's layout. You may need to reduce the text size or adjust the page margins."*

3. **Image Misalignment**:
   - *"Warning: This image is not aligned with the template’s design. Would you like to reposition it?"*

### Error Handling
If the Writer tries to switch to a template that conflicts with existing content (e.g., switching from a portrait layout to a landscape layout), the system should:
- **Alert the Writer** with a prompt like: *"Switching to this template will change the document layout. Some content may not fit. Would you like to adjust the document accordingly?"*
- Provide **automatic adjustments** where feasible or allow the Writer to adjust the content manually.

## 2. Performance Optimization and Caching

### Template Caching
To optimize performance, the system should cache templates and their associated assets (e.g., images, fonts) so that they do not need to be reloaded every time the Writer interacts with a document.

1. **Template Cache**: 
   - Cache frequently-used templates for a short period (e.g., 1 hour) to reduce load times when switching between templates.

2. **Asset Cache**: 
   - Cache assets like logos, images, and fonts associated with a template. Ensure these assets are loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking the page render.

3. **Lazy Loading**:
   - Lazy load images, logos, and other non-critical assets to improve the initial document load time. The rest of the content should be rendered first, with assets appearing as they load.

### Optimized Template Rendering
For complex templates with multiple design elements:
- **Break templates into smaller components** (e.g., headers, footers, content blocks) for efficient rendering.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track loading times of templates and optimize for any bottlenecks.

## 3. Template Marketplace API

### API Endpoints for Template Marketplace

1. **Upload Template**:
   - This endpoint allows a Designer to upload new templates to the marketplace.

   ```http
   POST /api/templates/upload
   ```

   **Request Body**:
   ```json
   {
     "template_name": "Marketing Flyer",
     "version": "1.0",
     "created_by": "designer123",
     "category": "Marketing",
     "description": "A template for creating marketing flyers",
     "styleSettings": {
       "fontFamily": "Arial",
       "fontSize": "14pt"
     },
     "layoutSettings": {
       "pageMargins": "1 inch",
       "headerPosition": "top",
       "footerPosition": "bottom"
     },
     "designElements": {
       "logoPosition": "top-left",
       "imageAlign": "center"
     },
     "metadata": {
       "tags": ["flyer", "marketing", "business"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Search Templates**:
   - This endpoint allows Writers and Designers to search for templates in the marketplace.

   ```http
   GET /api/templates/search
   ```

   **Query Parameters**:
   - `category` (optional): Filter by template category.
   - `tags` (optional): Search by tags.

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "templates": [
       {
         "template_id": "template123",
         "name": "Business Report",
         "category": "Business",
         "preview_image": "url_to_image",
         "tags": ["business", "report"]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Retrieve Template Details**:
   - This endpoint retrieves detailed information about a specific template.

   ```http
   GET /api/templates/{template_id}
   ```

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "template_id": "template123",
     "name": "Business Report",
     "version": "1.0",
     "styleSettings": {
       "fontFamily": "Arial",
       "fontSize": "14pt"
     },
     "layoutSettings": {
       "pageMargins": "1 inch",
       "headerPosition": "top",
       "footerPosition": "bottom"
     },
     "designElements": {
       "logoPosition": "top-left",
       "imageAlign": "center"
     },
     "metadata": {
       "description": "A template for business reports.",
       "tags": ["business", "report"]
     }
   }
   ```

## 4. Security and Data Protection

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Designers have permission to create, modify, and delete templates, while Writers can only apply templates to documents.
- Implement API security using authentication tokens to ensure only authorized users can perform sensitive actions (like uploading or editing templates).

### Template Asset Security
- All assets (e.g., images, fonts) used in templates should be stored securely, with appropriate access control. Designers have the ability to manage these assets, but Writers are restricted from modifying or downloading them.

### Data Encryption
- All template data, including layout settings, images, and user-specific content, should be encrypted both at rest and in transit to ensure data protection.
