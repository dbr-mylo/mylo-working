# Tech Stack Details for Mylo

## 1. Frontend: **React**
- We’ll be using React for the frontend to build a dynamic and interactive user interface. React's flexibility will help us create the panels, dashboards, and real-time features necessary for Mylo.

## 2. Backend: **Supabase**
- For the backend, we'll continue using Supabase. This will handle user authentication, data storage, and real-time features. Supabase's PostgreSQL database will be sufficient to manage the user data, templates, and documents.

## 3. AI Integration: **OpenAI**
- The AI features of Mylo will use **OpenAI** for content generation and writing assistance. In the future, we may incorporate more advanced AI tools like TensorFlow or Google AI to support design automation.

## 4. File Handling: **Mammoth.js**
- **Mammoth.js** will be used for importing and exporting Word files, converting them into clean HTML that can be edited within Mylo. For now, this is the only file type we plan to support, but we may expand in the future.

## 5. Authentication & Security: **Supabase Authentication**
- **Supabase's built-in authentication** will handle secure logins and user management. It also supports OAuth for easier login options, such as Google and GitHub.

## 6. Deployment: **Vercel**
- We’ll use **Vercel** for deployment, which integrates seamlessly with React. It provides serverless functions, automatic scaling, and fast deployments, making it ideal for Mylo.

## 7. Version Control: **GitHub**
- We’ll be using **GitHub** for version control, allowing us to track code changes and collaborate with any future developers.
