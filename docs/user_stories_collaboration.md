# Writer User Stories
1. **Sign-in/Sign-up**: As a Writer, I want to be able to sign in with my email or Google account so that I can start working on documents quickly.
2. **Dashboard**: As a Writer, I want to see recent documents and available templates on the dashboard so that I can quickly continue my work or select a template.
3. **Create/Edit Document**: As a Writer, I want to create a new document or edit an existing one, with the freedom to format text as I wish while seeing a preview of the final output based on the template.
4. **Real-time Preview**: As a Writer, I want the template styles (font, alignment, headings) to be applied automatically in the preview so that I can focus on content creation.
5. **Export Document**: As a Writer, I want to be able to export my final document as a PDF that follows the template rules for consistent formatting.

# Designer User Stories
1. **Sign-in/Sign-up**: As a Designer, I want to be able to sign in with my email or Google account so that I can manage templates and branding elements for the team.
2. **Dashboard**: As a Designer, I want to access the templates I've created or have been assigned to, so that I can manage and assign them to various projects.
3. **Create/Edit Templates**: As a Designer, I want to create or edit templates by adjusting fonts, spacing, and other style settings so that I can ensure consistency across documents.
4. **Assign Templates**: As a Designer, I want to assign templates to projects or specific documents, ensuring that Writers follow the correct format.
5. **Version Control**: As a Designer, I want to track changes to templates and roll back to previous versions if necessary, for maintaining the integrity of the design.

# Collaborative Interaction
- **Writers** interact with **Designers** primarily through templates. The Designer ensures the overall branding and style consistency, while the Writer focuses on content and formatting, but only within the bounds set by the template.
- **Writers** have the freedom to create content but will always see a "template preview" enforcing the set rules (for consistent formatting). If necessary, Writers can request feedback or minor changes from Designers.
- **Designers** review documents from the Writer role to ensure adherence to the template and branding, suggesting changes or creating new templates as needed based on feedback.
