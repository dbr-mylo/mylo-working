# **Role-Based Routing and Permissions for the Writer Role**

## **Overview**
We need to ensure proper **role-based routing** and **permissions** are implemented for the **Writer** role throughout the app. The **Writer** role should have access to **content editing** and **basic text formatting** but should not be able to interact with **design-related** features (like layout, templates, or styles).

## **Objectives**
1. **Ensure the Writer role only has access to relevant routes and features**.
2. **Prevent unauthorized access** to pages and components intended for the **Designer** role.
3. **Conditionally render UI elements** based on the user's role.
4. **Provide clear feedback** if a user tries to access a restricted section.

## **1. Route-Based Logic for Writer Pages**
- **Objective**: Ensure that the **Writer** role can only access the **content editing pages** and not any **design-related pages**.
- **Action**: 
    - Use **React Router** to define **role-based access** for each route.
    - If the user is a **Writer**, allow access to routes like `/write`, `/documents`, and `/drafts`.
    - If the user is a **Designer**, allow access to routes like `/templates`, `/design-settings`, and `/layout`.

    **Example Route Protection**:
    ```jsx
    <Route
      path="/design-settings"
      element={isDesigner ? <DesignSettings /> : <Navigate to="/write" />}
    />
    ```

    This will ensure that only **Designers** can access the **design settings** page, while **Writers** are redirected to the **writing** page.

---

## **2. Permission-Based Logic for Components or Features**
- **Objective**: Ensure that the **Writer** can only access **basic text formatting tools** and **content editing** features.
- **Action**:
    - **Hide or disable** design-related buttons and features (like font settings, templates, page margins) for the **Writer** role.
    - **Conditionally render toolbar buttons** based on the role.

    **Example (React JSX)**:
    ```jsx
    <button disabled={role !== 'Designer'}>Manage Template</button>
    ```

    This ensures that the **Writer** will not be able to interact with features intended for the **Designer**.

---

## **3. Redirection and Access Control Based on Role**
- **Objective**: Redirect the **Writer** if they try to access **Designer-only pages**.
- **Action**:
    - Use **React Routerâ€™s `Navigate`** to redirect **Writers** away from restricted pages (e.g., template management, layout settings).
  
    **Example of Redirecting Unauthorized Access**:
    ```jsx
    <Route path="/design" element={isWriter ? <Navigate to="/write" /> : <DesignPage />} />
    ```

    This ensures that **Writers** will not see the **Designer-specific** pages like `/design`.

---

## **4. Feedback and Alerts for Unauthorized Access**
- **Objective**: Provide feedback if a **Writer** tries to access restricted features or routes.
- **Action**:
    - If a **Writer** tries to access a **Designer-only page**, show a **modal** or **alert** informing them of the restriction.

    **Example**:
    ```jsx
    if (role !== 'Designer') {
      alert('Access denied. You do not have permission to edit templates.');
      return <Navigate to="/write" />;
    }
    ```

    This provides **clear feedback** to the **Writer** so they understand why they are being redirected.

---

## **5. Testing and Validation**
- **Objective**: Ensure the routing and permission checks work as expected.
- **Action**:
    - **Test the role-based routing** to ensure that:
      - **Writers** are redirected from **Designer-only pages**.
      - **Writers** can access only content creation and editing pages.
      - **Designers** have access to all design-related pages and settings.
    - **Test the UI** to ensure:
      - Only relevant buttons are shown to the **Writer**.
      - Designer tools are hidden or disabled for the **Writer**.
    - **Test role-based redirects** to ensure that **Writers** who attempt to access restricted routes are correctly redirected.

---

## **Summary of Implementation**
1. **Routing**: Ensure that **Writer** and **Designer** routes are properly protected and accessible only by the appropriate role.
2. **Permissions**: Ensure that **Writer** only has access to content editing tools and **cannot access design-related features**.
3. **Redirection**: **Writers** should be redirected away from **Designer-only** pages, with appropriate feedback.
4. **Testing**: Manually test all routes, UI elements, and role-based permissions to ensure everything works correctly.

### **Additional Notes**
- Please ensure that the **Writer** role is **restricted** from modifying design elements or layout settings.
- Implement **clear feedback** (tooltips, alerts, or modals) when a **Writer** tries to access restricted features.
