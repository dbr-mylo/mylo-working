# User Guide: Error Handling & Document Recovery

## Document Recovery & Backup

The application automatically creates backups of your work to protect against data loss. This system ensures that even if something goes wrong, your content is safe.

### How Document Recovery Works

- **Automatic Backups**: The system automatically saves your work to your device's local storage as you edit
- **Recovery on Restart**: If the application closes unexpectedly, your most recent changes will be recovered the next time you open the document
- **Manual Recovery**: The "Recover from backup" option appears when a backup is available

### Tips for Document Safety

1. Allow automatic saving to complete before closing the application
2. Watch the save status indicator in the top navigation bar
3. If you see "Offline" status, your changes will be saved locally until connection is restored

## Understanding Error Messages

The application provides helpful error messages that adapt to your role in the system.

### Common Error Types
